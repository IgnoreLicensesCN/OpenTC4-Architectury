* blockEldritch metadata 6:Not used,only in code but no language file defined.should be IShapeConnectNearBlock if i want to add.Aspects:1Alien,2Machine,2Metal.texture:deco_1.Drops nothing.

* blockCustomOre metadata 15:texture called "frostshard".however,same as what you can throw out from a wand focus.No aspect.causes crush after mined(considered as ItemShard but they cannot handle this metadata,boom).
