<p>maybe it should be unlicensed,i didn't get allowed from anazor.</p>
<p>anyway,IgnoreLicenses.</p>
<p>we will start in <a href="https://github.com/IgnoreLicensesCN/OpenTC4">decompiled TC4</a> </p> 


-----------------------

<p>since tc4 has many extensions and they made tc4 colorful.I have to "take care of" them --rewriting and extending API is needed.</p>
<p>it's not a good idea to use LLM to fast impl this proj.They would make this messy:making duplicate utils and little abstracts would be less extensible.</p>
<p>and it's so many years.many modders left and i think it's not needed to be hurried to make this project.maybe i have to rewrite some of those extension mods.</p>
<p>slowly,slowly</p>
